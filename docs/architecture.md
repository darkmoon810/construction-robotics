# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the architecture for the Robotics Dashboard project. The system is designed to facilitate the development and deployment of robotic applications, leveraging various components for data processing, visualization, and integration with external services.

## System Components

1. **Application Layer**
   - The main application is built using Streamlit, providing an interactive user interface for users to interact with the robotic systems.
   - The application is structured into several modules, each responsible for specific functionalities.

2. **Core Module**
   - **Agents**: Handles communication with AI agents, enabling decision-making processes.
   - **Simulation**: Processes simulation data, allowing for testing and validation of robotic behaviors.
   - **Visualization**: Generates plots and visual representations of data for better insights.

3. **Models Module**
   - Defines the data schemas for various components, including chat messages, robot specifications, and simulation metrics.

4. **Services Module**
   - Integrates with external APIs and services, such as Slack for notifications and ROS for robotic control and communication.
   - Loads 3D models from Omniverse for enhanced visualization.

5. **Utilities Module**
   - Contains helper functions for configuration management, logging, and data generation for development purposes.

## Deployment

The project utilizes Docker for containerization, ensuring consistent environments across development and production. The `docker-compose.yml` file orchestrates the necessary services, while the `Dockerfile` defines the image configuration.

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite is included, with unit tests for individual modules and integration tests for external service interactions. This ensures the reliability and stability of the application.

## Conclusion

The Robotics Dashboard project is designed with modularity and scalability in mind, allowing for easy enhancements and integrations as robotic technologies evolve.
